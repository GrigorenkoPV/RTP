abstract = {RAID triple parity (RTP) is a new algorithm for protecting against three-disk failures. It is an extension of the double failure correction Row-Diagonal Parity code. For any number of data disks, RTP uses only three parity disks. This is optimal with respect to the amount of redundant information required and accessed. RTP uses XOR operations and stores all data un-encoded. The algorithm's parity computation complexity is provably optimal. The decoding complexity is also much lower than that of existing comparable codes. This paper also describes a symmetric variant of the algorithm where parity computation is identical to triple reconstruction.},

abstract = {Row-Diagonal Parity (RDP) is a new algorithm for protecting against double disk failures. It stores all data unencoded, and uses only exclusive-or operations to compute parity. RDP is provably optimal in computational complexity, both during construction and reconstruction. Like other algorithms, it is optimal in the amount of redundant information stored and accessed. RDP works within a single stripe of blocks of sizes normally used by file systems, databases and disk arrays. It can be utilized in a fixed (RAID-4) or rotated (RAID-5) parity placement style. It is possible to extend the algorithm to encompass multiple RAID-4 or RAID-5 disk arrays in a single RDP disk array. It is possible to add disks to an existing RDP array without recalculating parity or moving data. Implementation results show that RDP performance can be made nearly equal to single parity RAID-4 and RAID-5 performance.},
